# Node.js Express Prisma Starter Template

A robust and scalable Node.js server template built with Express, Prisma, and TypeScript. This project is designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications, with Docker support for easy development and deployment.

## Features

- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **Prisma ORM**: A next-generation ORM that provides type-safe database access and schema management.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed JavaScript for better code quality and maintainability.
- **Esbuild**: A fast and modern bundler optimized for TypeScript and JavaScript projects.
- **PM2**: Advanced process management for Node.js applications, with support for clustering and monitoring.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments and simplified deployment.
- **Husky & Lint-Staged**: Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Tools for maintaining consistent code style and quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended for managing packages)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-express-prisma-starter-template.git
   cd node-express-prisma-starter-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` and filling in the necessary variables.

4. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Development

For development, the server will automatically reload with changes:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The development environment is configured to mount your local `src`, `public`, and `prisma` directories into the Docker container, allowing for instant feedback during development.

### Linting and Formatting

To check for linting errors:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
```

To run TypeScript type checks:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

## Deployment

For production, ensure your `.env` file is configured correctly and build the production image:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
```

This command will build the project using the `production` stage of the Dockerfile and start the containers.
